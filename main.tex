% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***

%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else

% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
   \graphicspath{{figs/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath
\usepackage{amsthm}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}




% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}


\nocite{Sibgrapi2021}

Many problems in science and engineering involve solving square systems of
algebraic equations or multivariate polynomials, where the number of unknowns is
the same as the number of constraining equations, and for which there is a
zero-dimesional (i.e., finite) set of solutions. These exactly constrained 
problems also known as minimal problems in 3D computer vision. Minimal problems
can exactly reconstruct geometric models from minimal correspondence data, which is crucial
for bootstrapping camera or robot localization from extremely high-outlier
measurements. In this paper, we study fine-grained code-level optimizations to a
generic numerical solver
approach that scales to highly nonlinear minimal problems. One such problem is the 3D
reconstruction of feature points and camera pose from three images, using the
minimal data of three SIFT feature
correspondences~\cite{Fabbri:Kimia:etal:CVPR2020}.

% TODO: cite handcrafted solvers
Gr\"obner basis solvers are a standard generic techniques for tackling minimal problems of low to
moderate degrees of nonlinearity~\cite{Cox-UAG-1998,Cox-IVA-2015,Nister:PAMI04}. 
% TODO: cite astrom and pajdla papers
They are implemented in most
cell phones and autonomous cars, solving problems in augmented reality and
self-localization in the order of tens of microseconds in conventional CPUs.
%
% TODO: be more specific
%For instance, they
%can solve the 5 point problem, a problem with 5 degrees of nonlinearity, in
%about 40 microseconds in standard CPUs.
%
These techniques, however, have not been able to scale towards larger 
problems, since more degrees of freedom usually imply high nonlinearity beyond
the cabapility of these solvers. Problems of algebraic degree 60 and
beyond~\cite{Fabbri:Kimia:etal:CVPR2020} are either completely intractable by these techniques, or can
only be solved in an unstable fashion. One reason is that they have to
symbolically eliminate multiple variables down to a single variable.
% TODO: cite relative pose variant of degree 60

Recently, fast numerical continuation have superseded Gr\"obner bases as a
generic technique for solving highly
nonlinear minimal problems. Continuation solvers rely on generic
linear system solver technology and polynomial evaluation, rather than symbolic elimination and eigenvalue
problems. A solver framework called MiNUS (Minimal Problem Numerical
Continuation Solver) has recently been able to solve previously untractable
highly nonlinear problems, involving high degrees of nonlinearity (algebraic degrees)
in the order of a few hundreds~\cite{Fabbri:Kimia:etal:CVPR2020}.  The solution is stable, as the
numerical technique allows eliminating variables only to a certain, convenient
point, after which all equations are treated simultaneously and symmetrically.
Moreover, the continuation solver has 100 lines of generic C++ code that works
for any minimal problem. Optimizing this code would positively impact a large
array of
problems~\cite{Duff:Kohn:Leykin:Pajdla:PLMP:2019,Duff:Kohn:Leykin:Pajdla:PL1P:Arxiv2020},
possibly even competing with Grobner basis on highly important problems of
moderate degrees.

One such highly nonlinear problem is the 3D reconstruction of relative camera
pose (rotation and translation) given only three (oriented) feature point
correspondences across three images. Referred to as the Chicago problem, it has degree 312 and was first be
reliably solved by the generic framework in the order of hundreds of miliseconds
to 1s.
%TODO Figure~\ref{fig:trifocal}. 
If this and similar problems could be
optimized to run in the order of microseconds, the field of structure from
motion and multiview 3D reconstruction would arguably be revolutionized by the
use of such a generic, globally convergent and stable algorithm, potentially
making its way to the hardware of cellphones and autonomous cars, extending what
current Gr\"obner basis solver technology is capable of in augmented reality and
navigation.

This work reviews and discusses computer science techniques for source-code
optimization of numerical continuation code in multicore CPUs, with emphasis on
memory layout, cache analysis, straight line program vectorization, surveying
the most promising possibilities for further optimization. 

\section{Numerical continuation core solver}

Numerical continuation solvers simulate a dynamical system, tracing the motion
of multiple particles from an initial to a final, target state that yelds the
solution to the desired problem. The moving particles correspond to the multiple
complex solutions to a family of polynomial systems interpolating the target
system to be solved and a database of previously solved systems of the similar
form constructed using synthetic data. For instance, to discover the position of
three cameras given correspondence data in three images, the code incrementally
deforms a set of previsouly constructed configurations of cameras and image data
until it maches the observed data. This is globally convergent, at least when
this process is carried out in multiple complex variables, as in current
practice.

We focus on the MiNuS framework, which is the state of the art continuation
framework for minimal problem solvers. We may define a specific system of
polynomials $F(x;\param)$, where $x$ is the set of
unknowns, and the coefficients of the equations are parametrized by a set of
data parameters $\param$.
MiNuS employs a fundamental technique for solving such systems called
\emph{coefficient-parameter homotopy}~\cite{SWbook,BertiniBook}.
Algorithm~\ref{alg:homotopy} summarizes homotopy continuation from a known set
of solutions for given parameter values to compute a set of solutions for the
desired parameter values. It assumes that solutions for some starting parameters
$\param_0$ have already been computed via some offline, \emph{ab initio}
phase. For our problems of interest, the number of start solutions is precisely
the algebraic degree of the problem.

	  }
	}
	\Return Computed solutions $x^*$ where $H(x^*,1) = 0$.

	\label{alg}
\end{algorithm}

For the 3-point trifocal relative pose problem, $x = (\srot_2, \srot_3,
\stransl_2, \stransl_3)$ encodes the rotation and translations of the second
and third views relative to the first camera. The parameters $\param$ encode the configuration of three feature point
correspondences in three views, with orientation used from two of the three feature
to yield a minimal problem. The implementation used in our
experiments employ 14 variabes and 14 equations and represent the point
configurations and auxiliary parameters with 56 numbers, so that $x \in \mathbb{C}^{14}$
and $\param \in \mathbb C^{56}$. Since this trifocal minimal problem has
algebraic degree 312, the for loop in Algorithm~\ref{alg:homotopy} runs from 1 to
312. The linear systems to be solved at each step are all $14 \times 14$.

The actual MiNuS solver framework implements Algorithm~\ref{alg:homotopy} in about 100 lines of
efficient templated C++ code. In order to better understand the memory layout, we describe
the variables in greater detail, mapping to the names in the C++ code.

By taking the total derivative of $H(x,t) = 0$, one can write the predictor step
as
\begin{align}
  H_x \frac{dx}{dt} &= -H_t,
\end{align}
which is a linear system in 14 variables $\frac{dx}{dt}$. 
From this, an initial prediction of $x_0$ is generated.
This is brought closer to zero by the corrector step, which seeks $\Delta x$ such
that a linear approximation to $H$ at $x_0$ is zero at $x_1 = x_0 + \Delta x$.
This involves solving the following linear system
\begin{align}
  H_x \Delta x = H.
\end{align}
MiNuS presently solves these $14\times14$ complex linear systems using Eigen's LU
decomposition, and the corrector step is performed at most $4$ times per solve.

% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Conclusion}
We presented work in progress towards fine-graine optimization of numerical
continuation code, testing on trifocal algorithms.  The techniques are
useful for similar algorithms such as simulating nonrigid deformation and
dynamical systems.
